## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was created to:

- Practice **core C programming concepts**
- Learn **modular programming using header files**
- Build a **large structured real-world project**
- Improve **logic building and problem-solving skills**
- Understand how real software is organized into multiple modules  

It is also intended to help beginners perform mathematical and utility operations easily from a single program.

## 🧩 Concepts Used in C Language

This project uses many important C programming concepts:

- Functions and Modular Programming  
- Header Files (`.h`) and Source Files (`.c`)  
- Loops (for, while, do-while)  
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch-case)  
- Arrays and Strings  
- File Handling (History Logging System)  
- Mathematical Functions and Libraries  
- User Input and Output Handling  
- Structured Program Design
